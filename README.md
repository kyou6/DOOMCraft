## 🖥️ DoomCraft
DoomCraft is a first person shooter game, with an objective to fend off hordes of
demons and the undead to save Earth from an apocalyptic invasion. Taken
inspiration from the iconic game franchise from 1993 called “DOOM” and the most
widely popular game in the world, “Minecraft”. This game aims to have a DOOM-styled gameplay experience, but also with a Minecrafty feeling to it.
